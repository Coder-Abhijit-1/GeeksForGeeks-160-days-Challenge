# 💻 GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **160 Days of DSA Challenge**, inspired by GeeksforGeeks! 🚀  
This repository contains my daily problem-solving journey focused on mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** through consistent practice.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

- **Duration**: 160 Days
- **Platform**: [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- **Goal**: Improve problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation in DSA.
- **Language Used**: Java (mainly), with some C and Python where applicable.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Throughout the challenge, I’ve worked on a wide range of topics, including:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Sliding Window & Two Pointer Techniques  
- Hashing & Prefix Sum  
...and more!

Each folder contains:
- The problem statement (brief)
- My approach/logic
- Code implementation
- Time and space complexity (where applicable)

## 🏁 Objective

The aim of this challenge is not just to complete problems but to **understand patterns**, improve **coding speed**, and become **interview-ready**.
